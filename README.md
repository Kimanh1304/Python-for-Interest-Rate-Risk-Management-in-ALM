# Python-for-Interest-Rate-Risk-Management-in-ALM
## Introduction
Interest rate risk management is a critical aspect of Asset Liability Management (ALM) for banks and financial institutions. It involves assessing the potential impact of interest rate changes on an institution's financial position and implementing strategies to mitigate those risks.
Interest rate models are mathematical representations of the behavior of interest rates over time
## Implementing Interest Rate Models
Vasicek Model: A mean-reverting model that assumes interest rates follow a normal distribution.
The Vasicek model is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of interest rates over time, considering mean reversion, volatility, and randomness.

Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) Model: Another mean-reverting model, but it ensures non-negative interest rates by assuming a square-root process.
The CIR model is another popular interest rate model. It improves upon the Vasicek model by ensuring that the interest rates are always non-negative. This is achieved by incorporating a square-root term in the model
## Analyzing Interest Rate Risk
Once the interest rate models are implemented, they can be used to analyze interest rate risk. One common method is calculating Value at Risk (VaR), which measures the potential loss in value of an asset or portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.
